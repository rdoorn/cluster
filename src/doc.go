/*
Package cluster implements a interface for clustered services. It allows you
to interace to a cluster node, and messages sent across will be received by
the connected cluster nodes. You can interface freely between these N nodes.
Additionaly there is also an API interface for passing commands to the cluster.

Interfacing

You can interface through the Cluster Manager using channels. Messages that
are not used specificly by the cluster are forwarded to the client application
using this cluster library.


manager.ToCluster <- interface{} // send data to the cluster
package := <-manager.FromCluster // recieve Package{} from the cluster containing the sent data (required)

This interface allows you to send data to the cluster, which will be
broadcasted across the connected nodes.

state := <- manager.QuorumState // bool returning current quorum state, will update on node join/leave
node := <- manager.NodeJoin  // string of node joining the cluster
node := <- manager.NodeLeave // string of node leaving the cluster

These channels are available to read additional cluster status updates

request := <-manager.FromClusterApi // recieve APIRequest{} send via the API interface by a client

With APIEnabled you can recieve API requests though an authenticated web interface

log := <-manager.Log // recieve Logging from the debug package

Read the Log channel to receive cluster wide logging
